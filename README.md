# Project Theme
- We took inspiration from banking applications as banking is part of our day to day life in these recent years. Being able to pay online as well as having access to monthly reports of your spending allows for better money management towards customers.

This API was coded in Java. We used the SpringBoot that implements the Spring Framework as well as Postman and H2 database to view the API request endpoints.
